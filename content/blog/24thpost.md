UK business groups says tax clarity needed at budget to support investment

By David Milliken

LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - British finance minister Rachel Reeves needs to strike a positive tone at her first budget on Oct. 30 in order to give businesses the confidence to invest, the Confederation of British Industry said on Tuesday.

After winning a large parliament majority on July 4, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the former Conservative government had left a dire economic legacy, including a 22-billion-pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances, which they said were in the worst state since World War Two.

Business and consumer sentiment weakened last month, partly out of concern about higher taxes, and the CBI said it was important the Reeves struck the right tone on Oct. 30.

"We recognise the chancellor is walking a fine line with limited fiscal headroom. While we cannot risk the economic stability that is the bedrock of growth, we must be ambitious in our vision with government laying the foundations for a prosperous future," CBI Chief Executive Rain Newton-Smith said.

Reeves has said taxes are likely to have to go up by more than Labour had planned before the election. But with Labour saying it will stick to its pledge not to raise headline rates of income tax, national insurance or value-added tax, some businesses are concerned that they will be targeted.

The CBI said Labour should set out a five-year roadmap for business taxation, including which areas were likely to be reviewed, similar to the approach taken by the Conservative-led coalition government in 2010.

The Federation of Small Businesses, which also released a set of budget requests on Tuesday, called for Reeves to fulfil an election pledge to reform business property taxation to help small retailers and also to ensure a partial exemption on social security charges kept pace with the rising minimum wage.

Labour has said it will keep the headline rate of corporation tax unchanged but has left the door open to other changes which would raise the overall tax burden.

Other areas where the CBI called for change included greater flexibility on which training courses were eligible for apprenticeship funding, tax breaks for green investment and spending on healthcare for staff and a nationwide rollout of funding for digital investment by smaller firms.

'Within days' of winning election, Lee promises:

<h2>UNC will scrap property tax</h2>

■ Kim Boodram

kim.boodram @trinidadexpress.com

THE OPPOSITION United National Congress (UNC) has promised to scrap the property tax 'within days' if re-elected to office.

Speaking yesterday during the UNC's Sunday media briefing, Pointe-a-Pierre MP David Lee also promised lower business taxes and more investment in energy, tertiary education and vocational training, as he again bashed the Government's 2024-2025 budget for lacking economic trajectory.

Lee highlighted some election promises laid out last week by Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar in her budget response, vowing to increase citizen safety, employment and raise living standards.

He endorsed Persad- Bissessar's promise that if re-elected she would reinstate the 'baby grant' for single parents, as well as pump funding into social and educational support networks in vulnerable communities.

Lee said the UNC continues to reject the Government's wage offer to public servants of four and five per cent, which he called 'unjust' and was 'imposed' on the workers. He said the UNC promised to engage in 'free and fair' bargaining through the office of the Chief Personnel Officer (CPO).

He also promised that a UNC government would establish a technical- vocational and teacher training facility, including through private sector partnership.

Right to bear arms

Lee on Sunday upheld Persad-Bissessar's position that citizens be afforded the right to bear arms and be able to defend themselves against criminals. He also backed the Opposition Leader's promise to implement a 'stand your ground policy' that favours citizens.

Lee also outlined promises in public healthcare, saying the UNC would establish 24-hour dialysis services at major hospitals, as well as establish a stroke rehabilitation centre.

He said revenue-generating plans included the revival of the energy sector to ensure returns to the country, saying T& T's energy industry was currently a 'rust belt'.

Accusing the Government of destroying oil and gas production, Lee said all major plants were operating at under 75%, with the most plant closures in the last nine years.

He said, according to the Central Bank, in 2015 some 20,500 people were employed in the energy sector but, by 2023, that had declined by 49.3 per cent to under 10,000.

Lee questioned warnings by Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley that the country was in for difficult economic times in the next two to three years, as well as the validity of the Government's promised boom by 2027. He said four bid rounds in the last nine years have failed and that the Government is unable to say when the first benefits will be seen in its cross-border negotiations with Venezuela. He suggested that the Government needed to incentivise energy companies to explore, stating that companies in Point Lisas were 'crying out' for gas.

He said the Government had failed to deliver on its renewable energy promises, asking what was being done with lands at St Augustine designated for a solar energy project.

He also called on the Government to state how much was spent on fuel subsidy for the last fiscal year, as it had asked for an additional $500 million towards this expense in the last midyear review.

Lee said the mid-year allocation was approved and would have been in addition to the previous allocation of $500 million, so that the 'yellow books' providing budget details should have reflected a total $1 billion in fuel subsidy. However, he said only $470 million was evident in the books and called for further clarification.

Lee said the shutdown of Petrotrin had decimated communities on the southern peninsula and the Government was yet to fulfil its promise to create alternative employment. He again asked about the status of the pension plan due to former Petrotrin employees, especially those in the Pointe-a-Pierre constituency.

He also questioned when closure would be brought to the Paria diving tragedy of 2022, stating that the families of the five divers who died in the incident were yet to be compensated or receive word of when the matter will be concluded.

He asked how people were expected to survive, recalling the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Lee urged the population to read the Opposition Leader's budget response, calling it an 'excellent' plan.

<h2>Miss World T&T gets $100,000 boost</h2>

<img src="/img/image24.5.jpg" alt="picture"/>


SPONSORSHIP: West Bees Supermarket owner Lalla Bachew, right, presents a cheque for $100,000 to Miss Trinidad and Tobago World Anna-Lise Nanton at UPick, Chaguaramas, on Wednesday.

MISS World T& T Anna-Lise Nanton received $100,000 from the owners of West Bees supermarket to assist in her journey for the crown in 2025. She was also given a leased vehicle by FiftySix Auto Ltd for her use until she departs Trinidad for the Miss World pageant next year.

A ceremony was held at UPick Farms in Chaguaramas, on Wednesday, where Nanton launched her Beauty With a Purpose Project 'The Ripple Effect'. The segment singles out and recognises the Miss World contestant who is shown to have made a real difference to people in need in her homeland.

Nanton has a sporting background and is actively involved in track and field. Speaking at the launch, she said her project will incorporate teaching children to swim. Swimming skills, she said, is not a privilege that everyone has and she wants to work on changing that.

As part of her project she will be hosting beginner sports sessions for women of all ages and levels. She said together with the Sports Company of Trinidad and Tobago (SPORTT), they will teach the life-saving skills of swimming to children across the nation, particularly those in care homes. Nanton said they will also be launching an initiative to upgrade sports facilities using green techniques to positively impact the environment.

Further, in collaboration with a company called WizdomCRM, a digital literacy platform will be used to merge sport sustainability with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to educate children across the nation. 'Imagine a personal AI tutor designed with my knowledge but with 1,000 times the capacity to be able to guide students 24/7 anywhere in the country or even in the world,' Nanton said.

She explained the AI platform will teach children to make eco-friendly choices, educate them on health and wellness among other positive aspects that will empower them to create their own ripple of change.

'This is the ripple effect; from one ripple comes a wave, from many waves, a sea of change,' she said. Nanton said she will also be rolling out a podcast where she will speak to guests such as Olympic swimmers, climate activists and sports doctors. Sport, she added, taught her how to be resilient, confident and determined and also how to overcome failure.

Miss World Franchise holder Charu Locan Dass expressed deep gratitude to all sponsors and supporters of the Miss World delegate.

'Without asking, Brian and Lalla Bachew of West Bees Supermarket offered to sponsor a first prize of $100,000 to our winner. My body ran cold, because I could not believe what I was hearing. It was beyond my imagination to ever ask anybody for that level of support,' she said.

She expressed confidence in Nanton in bringing home the Miss World crown, adding that Nanton has been wearing the T& T coat of arms proudly on a necklace for the past six years with the hope of representing this country in sport but the Lord has willed it for her to represent her homeland at the Miss World competition.

This year in India, Aché Abrahams, Miss World Trinidad and Tobago came close to bringing home the crown and was officially named the second runner-up. The winner of Miss World 2024 was Krystyna Pyszkova of the Czech Republic.

Daily Roundup of Key US Economic Data for Oct. 8
02:46 PM EDT, 10/08/2024 (MT Newswires) -- The RealClearMarkets's sentiment index, the first consumer measure for October, rose to 46.9 from 46.1 in September, the highest reading since May 2023.

Any sentiment reading below 50 indicates more pessimism than optimism. The six-month outlook improved but remained below the breakeven point, while the personal financial outlook rose further above 50. However, confidence in federal economic policies fell further and financial stress increased.

The National Federation of Independent Business' monthly sentiment index rose slightly to 91.5 in September from 91.2 in August, with gains in five of the 10 components. However, uncertainty remains high.

"Small business owners are feeling more uncertain than ever," said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. "Uncertainty makes owners hesitant to invest in capital spending and inventory, especially as inflation and financing costs continue to put pressure on their bottom lines. Although some hope lies ahead in the holiday sales season, many Main Street owners are left questioning whether future business conditions will improve."

The international trade deficit narrowed to $70.43 billion in August from $78.92 billion in July as imports declined and exports rose.

There were import declines for industrial supplies and autos that offset gains in other categories.

Redbook reported that US same-store retail sales were up 5.4% year-over-year in the week ended Oct. 5, faster than a 5.3% gain in the prior week due to cooler weather that boosted sales of fall apparel and an early start to holiday promotions.

The Q3 GDPnow estimate from the Atlanta Fed is for a 3.2% gain, revised up from a 2.5% gain reported on Oct. 1. The next update is scheduled for Wednesday.


<h1>Hurricane Milton nears the coast of Florida</h1>

UPDATE 1-Airlines cancel flights, airports close as Hurricane Milton nears Florida
(Adds Allegiant statement in paragraph 7, details throughout)

By Abhinav Parmar

Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are canceling flights and adjusting schedules with some Florida airports closing in anticipation of disruptions as Hurricane Milton prepares to make landfall in the state on Wednesday.

As of Tuesday afternoon, 1,311 flights within, into, or out of the United States were delayed, and 701 were canceled, with that number expected to rise as more than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have already been canceled, according to flight tracking data provider FlightAware.

Southwest, one of the largest U.S. airlines, said it was adjusting its schedule at several airports that were pausing operations, including Tampa International Airport and Orlando International Airport.

Orlando International, one of the busiest airports in the U.S., said it would cease operations at 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday, according to a notice on its website, while Tampa International said it was closed on Tuesday.

Allegiant Air, Sun County Airlines and JetBlue Airways are among the carriers most likely to be negatively impacted if Hurricanes Milton and Helene, which hit Florida recently, weigh on travel demand, according to analysts at Raymond James.

JetBlue and Allegiant have canceled 41 and 92 flights, respectively, on Tuesday according to FlightAware, while Sun Country told Reuters it had canceled about 19 passenger flights.

"We expect service to resume later this week, but there are a variety of factors that will go into that decision," Allegiant Air said in a statement.

Hurricane Milton was expected to expand in size on Tuesday as it approaches Florida's battered Gulf Coast, where more than 1 million people were ordered to evacuate.

In response to the expected disruptions, some airlines including United Airlines, JetBlue and Air Canada have added extra capacity to move people out of Florida.

<h2>Microsoft May Take Up to $3 Billion in OpenAI Losses This Fiscal Year, Oppenheimer Says in Downgrade
02:54 PM EDT, 10/08/2024 (MT Newswires)</h2>
 Microsoft (MSFT) could face steep losses from its investment in OpenAI amid slow enterprise adoption, Oppenheimer said Tuesday while downgrading the stock.

The brokerage cut its rating on Microsoft to perform from outperform on the premise that consensus revenue and earnings estimates are too high.

"Enterprises have been slow to adopt (artificial intelligence) and associated revenues will likely disappoint," analyst Timothy Horan said.

OpenAI losses flowing through to Microsoft, which has a 49% stake in the parent of generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, could range between $2 billion and $3 billion in fiscal 2025, the brokerage said. Horan said he had not factored in these losses into his previous model. OpenAI reportedly expects a $5 billion loss this year, according to the Oppenheimer report.

The brokerage recently reduced estimates on Microsoft cloud computing service Azure by 100 basis points on a normalized basis for 2025, pointing to a slow enterprise adoption and a "bottleneck" related to infrastructure.

Oppenheimer lowered its fiscal 2025 earnings-per-share projection to $12.91 from $13.24, moving below the $13.21 consensus. It continues to forecast revenue of $275.91 billion for the ongoing year, compared with the $278.91 billion Street view. The brokerage's free cash flow estimate for the year was cut by 3% to $73.77 billion.

For fiscal 2026, Horan is now modeling EPS of $14.77, down from its $15.03 prior forecast and moving further below the $15.37 consensus.

Other factors contributing to the updated model are higher depreciation, lower interest income and increased operating expenses to support AI, Horan said. Expanding margins won't be a priority over the short term, he said.

<h1>AI pioneers win Nobel Prize in physics</h1>

■ STOCKHOLM

TWO pioneers of artificial intelligence-John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton-won the Nobel Prize in physics yesterday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionising the way we work and live but also creates new threats for humanity.

Hinton, who is known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton.

'These two gentlemen were really the pioneers,' said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce. 'They...did the fundamental work, based on physical understanding which has led to the revolution we see today in machine learning and artificial intelligence.'

The artificial neural networks-interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain-the researchers pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and 'have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation', said Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

'Huge influence' Hopfield, whose 1982 work laid the groundwork for Hinton's, told The Associated Press yesterday, 'I continue to be amazed by the impact it has had.'

Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a 'huge influence' on civilisation, bringing improvements in productivity and health care.

'It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,' he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

'Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us. And it's going to be wonderful in many respects,' Hinton said.

'But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.'

Warning of AI risks

The Nobel committee also mentioned fears about the possible flipside.

Moons said that while it has 'enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind'.

Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could speak more freely about the dangers of the technology he helped create.

Traders see an 88% chance of a 25 bp cut in November

Oct 10 (Reuters) - Gold prices extended gains on Thursday after traders added to bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver an interest-rate cut next month following the latest U.S. economic data.

Spot gold was up 0.6% at $2,622.69 per ounce as of 11:24 a.m. ET (1524 GMT)on track to snap a six-session losing streak. U.S. gold futures edged 0.5% higher to $2,639.90.

U.S. consumer prices rose slightly more than expected in September, but the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in more than 3-1/2 years. Another report showed that weekly jobless claims rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus estimates of 230,000.

"The CPI report didn't bring much of a surprise and the jobs numbers show a trend of weakening, which puts the notion that the track to cut rates, helping gold. Last few days, saw cooling in gold's rally, so it is in a good position to go back up," said Alex Ebkarian, chief operating officer at Allegiance Gold.

Markets now see an 88% likelihood of a 25-basis-point cut from the Fed next month versus 76% before the data, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Zero-yield bullion is a preferred investment amid lower interest rates.

Investors' focus will shift to U.S. Producer Price Index data on Friday for additional insights on rate cuts.

Heightened geopolitical events and strong demand led by central banks are the other positive catalysts for gold, Ebkarian added.

In the Middle East, Israel pressed its assault on Hezbollah and told Lebanese civilians not to return to homes in the south.

Spot silver rose 1.2% to $30.87 per ounce.

"Easing monetary policy and an undersupplied market will likely attract investor interest, with silver remaining an inexpensive alternative to gold," ANZ said in a note.

Platinum added 2.5% to $968.15, and palladium was up 1.9% to $1,059.77.
