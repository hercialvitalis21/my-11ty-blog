<h2>Fed Powell to cut rates</h2>

That's where September starts. The Fed meets Sept. 17-18 and almost certainly will cut its key federal fund rate from 5.25%-to-5.5%, the level in place since July 2023.

The conventional wisdom is the first cut will be to 5%-to-5.25%. Not a big cut but the first cut since July 2023.

Credit markets have already pushed the yield on the government's 2-year Treasury note down 22% from 5.1% in April to 3.92% on Aug. 30.

The 10-year Treasury yield, a key determinant of mortgage rates, has dropped 21% from just under 5% last October to 3.91% as of Aug. 30.

Mortgage rates are now below 6.5%, although national reports on housing suggest they haven't fallen far enough to make buyers brave enough to make offers.

There probably will be more cuts over the next year, and the behavior of Treasury yields are signals markets already are expecting them.
