<h1>Guyana, Jamaica collab on Junior Stock Exchange</h1>

THE Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) in Guyana on Friday said it is collaborating with the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) regarding the development of a Junior Stock Exchange in Guyana.

In a statement, the GCCI said that the information regarding the junior stock exchange was among matters announced at the second Regional Investments and Capital Markets Conference that ended here on Wednesday.

GCCI president, Kester Hutson, who participated in a panel discussion on 'the private sector's role in promoting sustainable wealth creation and prosperity' said among the reasons for the new initiative is the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMSE) need to have access to capital.

'The Chamber is excited about it, we need to expose our members to these opportunities. Jamaica Stock Exchange as a model that works,' Huston said.

The statement said that he also highlighted the work that the GCCI has undertaken in trade facilitation, including inbound and outbound trade missions, and increasing members' capacity in the area of trade and investment.

'The Chamber continues to really expose, engage and edify our members through these strategic programmes,' he said.

GCCI executive member Richard Rambarran, speaking in his capacity as country manager of NCB Capital Markets Incorporated (Guyana and Suriname), spoke on the role of broker-dealers and their role in capital markets.

In the Guyana context, he acknowledged the challenges with access to finance and financial institutions.

'We need to ask different questions. How can we begin to change the architecture so that we can have institutions in place that can begin to channel the types of monies that are required into the types of projects that are happening here in Guyana?' he said.

The statement said these remarks came on the heels of comments by Senior Minister of Government with responsibility for Finance, Dr Ashni Singh, who sought to assure the conference that Guyana has the necessary experience in building the institutions that are necessary for good governance, and sound and responsible economic management.

'We have done a lot of heavy lifting for a very long time and we didn't get here by accident. Guyana today is likely, possibly one of the most attractive places to do business in the world,' the statement quoted Dr Singh.

US SEC gives green light for options listing for spot bitcoin ETFs to NYSE

Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to 11 exchange-traded funds to list and trade options tied to spot bitcoin prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a regulatory filing.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry.

Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are among funds that received the approval on Friday.

The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date.

The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock's, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.
