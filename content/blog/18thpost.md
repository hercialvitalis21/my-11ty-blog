SporTT negligence claim against former board members

Expert witness to testify today

AN expert witness is expected to begin testimony today in the multi-million- dollar negligence claim brought by the Sport Company of Trinidad and Tobago (SporTT) against 14 of its former board members.

The claim centres around a failed $34 million contract related to the now-defunct LifeSport programme.

The trial started on Tuesday before Justice Ricky Rahim and continued yesterday, at the Waterfront Judicial Complex in Port of Spain, with the company's corporate secretary, Arlene George, completing her testimony.

Named as defendants in the lawsuit are the company's former chief executive officer John Mollenthiel and former board members Sebastian Paddington, Chela Lamsee-Ebanks, Reynold Bala, Norris Blanc, Nisa Dass, Anyl Gopeesingh, Sabrenah Khayyam, Cheemattee Martin, Matthew Quamina, Annan Ramnanansingh, Kent Samlal, Harnarine Seeram Singh and Milton Siboo.

Following the completion of the evidence-in-chief and cross-examination of the expert witness, the defendants in the case are expected to begin their testimonies tomorrow.

At yesterday's hearing, attorneys for the defendants completed their cross-examination of George, who was questioned over the contract eBeam Interact Ltd had to administer numeracy, literacy and the interactive technology components of the occupational skills training aspects of the programme.

Attorney Neil Bisnath, in his cross-examination of the witness, made reference to correspondence from the Sport Ministry, which he suggested directed the board to select eBeam based on a sole select tender.

George disagreed, saying that in her view no directive was given, but instead that the ministry had made a recommendation that eBeam be awarded the contract, which was entered into in 2013.

Senior counsel Rishi Dass and Anthony Vieira, SC, also completed their cross-examination of the witness. In the lawsuit, SporTT's lead attormey, Collin Kangaloo, SC, is arguing that the board members breached their fiduciary duty and acted recklessly and with incompetence in entering into the contract.

In opening the case on Tuesday, Kangaloo claimed none of the directors saw the contract when it was eventually signed and eBeam was paid half of the value.

The attorney rejected the group's claim that they only paid eBeam the balance on the contract after seeking legal advice in December 2013.

On August 22, High Court Justice Eleanor Donaldson-Honeywell rejected SporTT's breach of contract case against eBeam, but ordered it to pay $30 million in restitution as she ruled that it was unjustly enriched for services it did not provide.

While SporTT was seeking the entire value of the contract, Justice Donaldson-Honeywell deducted $4 million, which represented the nominal services inclusive of the procurement of equipment provided by eBeam.

In May of last year, a three-judge panel at the Appeal Court overturned a previous ruling of Justice Rahim in which he had struck out SporTT's $34 million negligence claim.

The judge had done so in November 2022, dismissing the negligence aspect of the lawsuit, saying even under breach of fiduciary duty, the company's claim could not be made out since the case, on a whole, did not appear to disclose clear, ascertainable evidence of loss suffered.

This, he said, was necessary since proof of actual loss or damage was a crucial part of the tort of negligence.

Appearing alongside Kangaloo for SporTT are attorneys John Lee and Stephanie Moe. Appearing along with Vieira, Dass and Bisnath for the defendants are Fyard Hosein, SC, Shiv Sharma, Karina Singh, Keston Lewis, Roger Kawalsingh, Ravi Mungalsingh, Tara Bhariosingh, Anil Maraj, Nicole de Verteuil- Milne, Adrian Ramoutar, Sushma Gopeesingh, Kamini Persaud-Maraj, Lydia Mendonca, Richard Jagai, Andrea Bhagwandeen and Dharmendra Punwassee.
