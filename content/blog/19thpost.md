CHINESE leader Xi Jinping will visit Russia next month for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi confirmed yesterday, in a move that comes as Moscow and Beijing seek to counter the West's global influence.

Xi's visit to Russia will be his second since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China claims to take a neutral position in the conflict, but it has backed the Kremlin's contentions that Russia's action was provoked by the West, and it continues to supply key components needed by Moscow for weapons production.

Wang Yi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday and the two hailed ties between the two countries. The Chinese foreign minister said Xi 'happily accepted' Putin's invite to attend the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October.

Putin, in turn, announced that the two will also sit down for a bilateral meeting in Kazan and discuss various aspects of the Russia-China relations, which 'are developing quite suc-cessfully' and 'in all directions'.

Xi last visited Russia in March 2023 and Putin reciprocated with his own trip to China in October. The two leaders have since also met in Beijing in May, where Putin took the first foreign trip of his fifth presidential term; and in Kazakhstan in July.

After launching what the Kremlin insists on calling a 'special military operation' in Ukraine, Russia has become increasingly dependent economically on China as Western sanctions cut its access to much of the international trading system. China's increased trade with Russia, totalling US$240 billion last year, has helped the country mitigate some of the worst blows from the sanctions.

Explain the risks in "Sell Covered Call Option"?


Show drafts


<h2>Risks of Selling a Covered Call Option</h2>
Selling a covered call option involves selling a call option against a stock that you already own. While this strategy can provide income and some downside protection, it's not without its risks. Here are the primary ones:

1. Limited Upside Potential:
Capped Gains: If the stock price rises significantly above the strike price of the call option, you'll be obligated to sell your shares at the strike price, even if the market price is much higher. This limits your potential profits.
2. Early Assignment Risk:
Forced Sale: The buyer of the call option may exercise their right to buy your shares at the strike price before the option's expiration date. This can force you to sell your shares prematurely, even if you're not ready to do so.
3. Downside Protection Limits:
Potential Losses: While covered calls can provide some downside protection, they don't guarantee a profit. If the stock price falls below the breakeven point (the original purchase price minus the premium received), you'll still lose money.
4. Transaction Costs:
Fees: Buying and selling options involves transaction costs, which can reduce your overall profits.
5. Tax Implications:
Short-Term Gains: If you sell your shares due to early assignment or at expiration, you may face short-term capital gains taxes, which can be higher than long-term capital gains taxes.
6. Market Volatility:
Increased Risk: In volatile markets, the price of options can fluctuate significantly, potentially affecting your profits or losses.
In summary, while selling covered call options can be a useful strategy for generating income and managing risk, it's important to understand the potential drawbacks before entering into such a trade. Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the specific characteristics of the underlying stock before making a decision.
