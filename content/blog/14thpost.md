ESG vs. SEE: A Comparative Analysis for Companies
ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and SEE (Social, Environmental, and Economic) are both frameworks that companies use to assess their impact on various stakeholders. While they share similar goals, there are some key differences between them.  

ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
Focus: Prioritizes the environmental, social, and governance aspects of a company's operations.  
Components:
Environmental: Climate change, resource conservation, pollution, biodiversity, and waste management.  
Social: Human rights, labor practices, community engagement, and product safety.  
Governance: Corporate governance, executive compensation, risk management, and transparency.  
Approach: Often used for investment decisions, corporate reputation management, and regulatory compliance.  
SEE (Social, Environmental, and Economic)
Focus: Emphasizes the economic performance of a company in conjunction with its social and environmental impact.
Components:
Social: Community development, job creation, and social equity.
Environmental: Sustainable resource management and environmental protection.
Economic: Financial performance, profitability, and economic growth.
Approach: Primarily used for measuring a company's overall sustainability and contribution to society.

Export to Sheets
In essence, while both ESG and SEE frameworks aim to promote sustainable business practices, ESG places more emphasis on the non-financial aspects of a company's performance, while SEE incorporates economic factors more prominently.

Which framework is best for a company depends on its specific goals, industry, and stakeholder expectations. Many companies find value in using both frameworks to assess their sustainability performance and inform their decision-making.

NOTES
1. World Bank, cited by C. Larraín, “Best Practices for Efficient Banking Restructuring,”
World Bank, 2002.
2. A. Sheng, “Bank Restructuring: Lessons from the 1980s,” World Bank, 1996, 1, cited in
Roy I. Ramos, “A Tale of Four Bank Restructurings,” Goldman Sachs, January 7, 1999.
3. Eventually, of course, the extraordinary situation, if it lasts for a prolonged period of
time, becomes the new normality.
4. The view that the worst is over springs from the observation that mild deviations from the
norm are self-correcting. When the deviation is mild, they normally are. The perspective is
illustrated in the following excerpt from economist Robert Solow’s review of Richard
Posner’s book, A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of ’08 and the Descent into Depression
(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2009), that summarizes Posner’s argument:
“A modern capitalist economy . . . can probably adapt to minor shocks . . . with just a
little help from monetary policy and mostly automatic fiscal stabilizers. . . . [Therefore]
[i]t is easy to be lulled into the comfortable belief that the [financial] system can take care

of itself if only do-gooders will leave it alone. But that same financial system has intrinsic
characteristics that can make it self-destructively unstable when it meets a large shock.”
R. Solow, “How to Understand the Disaster,” New York Review of Books 56, no. 8,
May 14, 2009. The “large shock” is the large deviation from the norm that is prone to
trigger a severe banking crisis. Concededly, to compensate, warnings of even worse
disasters to come sell more newspapers and magazines, and will also appear in abundance
as a crisis develops.
5. Roger Lowenstein’s book, When Genius Failed, tells the story of the pantheon of Wall
Street trading gurus who came together to create LTCM and how despite the brainpower
behind the fund, it was overwhelmed by unforeseen events. R. Lowenstein, When Genius
Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management (New York: Random
House, 2001).
6. Obviously, there is no set number of failures or rescues that can occur before a banking
crisis can be said to have been triggered, and in any event, it can only be known after the
fact. It only takes one such event to potentially set off a systemic crisis; conversely,
depending upon the size of the system, the level of concentration within the sector in
respect to assets and deposits and the specific causes of each failure or rescue, it is conceivable
that multiple bank failures could occur without such a crisis occurring.
7. Notwithstanding the wide use of the term bank restructuring to refer to the rehabilitation
of an entire banking system, it should be acknowledged that it is the view of some that the
latter should properly be termed systemic bank restructuring. See M. Waxman, “A Legal
Framework for Systemic Bank Restructuring,” World Bank, “Bank and Financial
Restructuring,” June 1998, 1.
8. See C. Dziobek and C. Pazarbasioglu, “Lessons from Systematic Bank Restructuring,”
International Monetary Fund, 2. (As an IMF report observed, “often a banking crisis
occurs before countries can muster the political will to undertake essential reforms.”)

War,” Policy Options (Montreal: Institute for Research on Public Policy, May 2009),

11. Occasionally, central bankers, regulators and even analysts concede their mistakes.
In mid-2009, with the worst of a banking crisis evidently past, the Chairman of U.S.
Federal Reserve acknowledged that the central bank did not act swiftly enough to
curb irresponsible mortgage lending. Don Lee, “Ben Bernanke Says Fed Didn’t Act
Quickly Enough to Stop Reckless Mortgage Lending, “Los Angeles Times, web edition,
July 29, 2009.

13. Even if an economic capital model is employed and the model states that capital is sufficient
for all but a once in a thousand year event, there is always the possibility that the
model is wrong.

18. Before the scope and severity of a burgeoning financial crisis have become evident, the
authorities responsible for overseeing a banking system may have been aware of fundamental
problems in the banking system. Moreover, they may have taken some steps to
address them, or sought to institute further reforms, while aware of the dangers a failure
to reform posed in the medium to long term without necessarily anticipating that one
was imminent. Undertaking fundamental reforms when the banking industry is doing
